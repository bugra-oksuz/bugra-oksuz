Hi,

 I'm Buğra Öksüz, and I've been developing my skills to become a Front-End Developer for almost 1.5 years. Recently, I applied for an education school and it will begin soon. In the meantime, I'm working as a freelancer on small projects to gain experience and earn some extra income.

Currently, I'm a student at Istanbul Beykent University, studying Industrial Design with a scholarship, and I'm in the preparatory year.
